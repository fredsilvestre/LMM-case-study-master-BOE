	- what is the best model structure
	- print a table with AIC
	- do the analysis of the model with fixed and random effects
	- what are the values of conditional repeatability for TDM
	- in few lines, draw the conclusions of your analysis, including a comparison between CDIS and TDM
	- develop in a few lines 3 perspectives to improve the study
